# Hello, thanks for reading this.


This is my attempt to learn how to generate a static website. it was really fun going from learning about inline, detecting using delimiters to turning md -> block -> block types -> lines -> inline components.

To test this out, simple make a copy of this and run

```
./main.sh
```

It should be running on your localhost:8000

Have fun!
